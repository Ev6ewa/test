    "I swear that not only does Hanna not touch her drink, but she almost glares at it with genuine hatred."
    "After that, she makes a point of looking the other way and even closing her eyes."
    "All rather than look at one perfectly innocent alcoholic beverage."

label hanna_date_buy_a_round:
    "Offering to buy a round, I catch sight of the look on Hanna's face and realise I've made a bad move."
    "She shakes her head and nods to her still full glass."
    "That leaves me going to the bar alone, feeling like some kind of alcoholic."
