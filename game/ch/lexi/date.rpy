label lexi_eat_a_burger_date:
    "Lexi wastes no time, practically grabbing her burger the moment that it arrives."
    "She proceeds to tear through it as if she doesn't know when she'll get to eat again."
    "Watching her go, I really don't know whether to be impressed or concerned!"

label lexi_date_buy_drink:
    "Drink in one hand and the other waving about in the air, Lexi is constantly either sipping or chattering."
    "And in between doing one and then the other, she pauses only to take in great gulps of air."
    "Try as I might, I can't seem to get a word in edgeways."
    return

label lexi_date_play_darts:
    "What Lexi lacks in skill when it comes to playing darts, she more than makes up for in enthusiasm."
    "Every time she manages to as much as hit the board with one of her throws seems to be cause for a celebration."
    "She jumps up and down on the spot, pumping her fist into the air with an unlit cigarette hanging from her lip."
    "A regular image of feminine grace..."

label lexi_date_pub_play_pool:
    "While she seems really eager for a game of pool, I don't know if Lexi's actually that interested in actually playing."
    "Sure, she takes her shots and sinks a few balls here and there."
    "But she seems to take fare more pleasure in leaning on the table in whatever provocative pose she can pull off."
    return

label lexi_date_buy_a_round:
    "At the mere mention of my buying another round, Lexi's up out of her seat and literally bouncing around."
    "She looks far too happy for someone that's simply been told that their next drink is on the way."
    "It makes me wonder just how much more energy she can have and how long she can keep this up!"
