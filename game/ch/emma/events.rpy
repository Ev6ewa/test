    "I can feel the leather of the leash wrapped around my hand as her weight strains against it, pulling it tighter."
    "It's an effort to keep the whole thing taught, what with the collar around her neck being how she's attached to it."
    "But I feel that I've done this many times before, and so has she, so I'm not particularly worried about her being choked."

    "Well, any more than she likes to be, that is..."
    "If anything, she seems to be more eager to struggle and strain than I am to pull hard on the leash so that it chafes at her."
    "She's crouched down in front of me, on all fours and completely naked save for the collar and leash."
    "The only sound apart from the straining of the leather is the jingling of the bell that hangs around her neck."
    "That and the sound of our own breathing, coming heated and heavy as we build up to what comes next."
    "She glances over her shoulder at me, pale cheeks flushed with excitement and anticipation."
    "I can see that she's keen for me to begin, wanting to feel the sensation of me inside her with a true sense of urgency."
    "And thanks to the angle that she's crouched at, I don't even need to part her buttocks to find her pussy."
    "Instead I can already see it's pink lips as they glisten invitingly before me, letting me know that she's already slick in anticipation."
    "I could easily place my hands on her buttocks and push inside of her without her moving as much as an inch."
    "But with the leash still held firmly in my hand, I have other ideas as I begin to wrap ever more of it around my clenched fist."
    "I hear her breathing quicken as the shortening of the leash means she's forced to move backwards an inch at a time."
    "All it takes is for me to make sure that my stiff cock is poised at just the right height as she does so."
    "Soon she feels the sensation of the head, pressing against the lips of her pussy."
    "But I'm not about to allow her the luxury of pausing to prepare herself - not that she'd want me to either."
    "And so instead I keep winding in the leash still further, making her keep on going."
    "I hear her gasp in reaction to the way she's being forced to take me in at a pace she cannot predict."
    "There's little need to be anything other than gentle with her in order to push inside, as she's already plenty wet enough."
    "But the uncertainty and lack of control is making her excitable, which in turn is making me all the more determined."
    "Keeping as still as I can manage, I savour the sensation of feeling her as she's pulled onto my cock."
    "Her body twitches as the feelings her body is experiencing come upon her without preamble or warning."
    "At the same time she moans and cries out from the pleasure she's feeling, her motions making the bell hung from her collar tinkle away almost constantly."
    "Once I'm in as far as I can go, I hold myself rigid inside of her, simply enjoying the prolonged feeling of excitement this gives me."
    "The effect is only made that much better by the sight of her limbs beginning to twitch and her backside shaking as I do so."
    "Feeling just a little merciful, I begin to thrust in and out of her a few moments later."
    "She lets out a deep, throaty groan in relief and begins to move in sympathy, her cheeks becoming even more red with the enjoyment of it all."




    "Her auburn hair is plastered to her head, darkened by the sweat that soaks it."
    "She casts her head around, almost like an animal lowing for relief as she receives satisfaction for her desires."
    "And then she throws it back so that her hair is tossed aside and slaps heavily against her shoulders and the nape of her neck."
    "I feel her sweat splash against my naked chest, wondering at the fact that she could be so drenched thanks to what we're doing together."
    "The only response that I can even think of making is to try and fuck her yet harder, feeling my balls slap against her backside as I do so."
    "I see her reach up for the collar at her throat in response, holding onto it for a moment as if to seek release."
    "If she had a bit in her mouth right now, I have no doubt that she'd be champing at it."
    "But she seems to realise swiftly that none will come from doing so, and her hand falls quickly to one of her heavy breasts."
    "Her fingers are squeezing and tugging almost desperately at her own erect nipple."
    "I see that she's trying to add yet more intensity to the act, hoping to bring about her climax as she does so."
    "Giving her one last yank on the leash, I feel myself letting go too."
    "I have no fear of thrusting forwards for a final time as I cum inside of her, sure in the knowledge that she's already pregnant."
    "Utterly exhausted, I expect to collapse at her side..."

    "And it's then that I suddenly wake up, bathed in sweat, wrapped in sheets and with the sensation of my own fast-cooling cum running down the inside of my thigh."

    "I don't know where this begins, just that I'm here and the time is now."
    "I'm walking through one of those hedge mazes, the kind they have in the grounds of stately homes and such."
    "I have no idea how I got here or exactly why I might have chosen to wander into a maze."
    "But as this is a dream, I guess none of that stuff is really relevant."
    "The one thing that I do know is that I'm hopelessly lost, although I don't know why I should know that and almost nothing else at all."
    "Standing well above the height of my own head, the hedges of the maze keep me from being able to anything outside of it."
    "My only options are to either go forwards or back, and it seems as though the former is the choice I keep making."
    "In the back of my mind, I can vaguely recall that to navigate a maze, you either need to always turn left or right."
    "But the frustrating thing is that I can't actually remember which of the two it is."
    "This means that I keep making turns that seem to be completely random and without a shred of reason to them."
    "More than once I find myself thinking that the maze surely can't be so big as to keep me lost like this forever."
    "If I keep wandering for long enough, there must be a way out."
    "It's then that I catch sight of something as it flits around the corner just ahead of me."
    "The slightest flicker of auburn hair and the last lingering notes of musical laughter, like the essence of a human being upon the air itself."
    "At this, my memory sparks and I remember for a second why I'm here at all."
    "I'm following on her heels, trying to catch even the most fleeting glimpse of the girl."
    "But thus far, she's always eluded me, and this only compels me to hurry on in the hope of catching her."
    "How I know the person ahead of me is a girl and just why I must follow her are things that, in the manner of a dream, don't seem to matter at all."
    "All that matters is that she keeps on slipping away around the corners that loom ahead of me and the fact that I have to catch her."
    "What I can see of her comes in snatched glimpses and what I can see out of the corner of my eye."
    "I perceive pale skin, eyes of blue, or green, or hazel that flit here and there in a round, laughing face."
    "Legs that disappear with the shimmer of tights catching the late sunlight of the afternoon as they do so."
    "But even as I grasp at these few elements of the whole which still eludes me, I see that she quickens her pace yet more."
    "I'm forced almost to run now, even to keep the barest glimpse of her heels ahead of me as I genuinely chase her through the endless maze"
    "Somehow the fact that we're running fills me with the impression that an end of some sort is fast approaching."
    "For a moment, I lose sight of her completely, and I can feel my heart begin to pound with a rising sense of panic at doing so."
    "And then I round one last corner, and come to a sudden halt."

    "There she is, standing with her back to me, no more than a couple of metres ahead."
    "I hold my hand up to her, wanting to close that last short distance that still lies between us."
    "But as I do so, she turns at the waist and regards me with one large eye, as her hair covers the other."
    "Now that I can see her this close and as still as a statue, I notice that she's tall for a girl, and yet very delicate in appearance."
    "Her slender limbs and pale skin almost give her the look of a child's doll that's been scaled up in size and somehow given the spark of life."
    "She looks at me in a manner that suggests familiarity, not at all surprised at my having followed her with such determination."
    unknown_girl_say "Well - are you ready for our date?"
    "And that's it - with the sound of her voice still ringing in my ear, I wake up."
    "But the image of her face and those few words are as real to me as if she were standing in front of me, right here and now."
