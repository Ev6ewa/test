label mike_date_pub_play_pool:
    "I make the mistake of letting Mike break, thinking that I'm being kind."

label mike_date_buy_a_round:
    "Ask Mike if he wants anything from the bar, and he shrugs, then nods."
    "He mutters that he'll get the next round in after this one."
    "So he's happy to let me stand a round, but will return the favour."
    "I guess that means he's a pretty modern kind of guy."
